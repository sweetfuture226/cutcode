# CutCode

As a developer, we often search on <strong>Google</strong> / <strong>StackOverFlow</strong> for doubts, issues related to our code and our projects, when programming / developing. As a result, we visit a lot of different posts, different websites to find the right solution to our problem, but time and (time) again, when we find a proper solution to your problem, we tend to forget where we found it or even the solution. Hence, we decided to create a tool that helps us save our answers as small snippets, so that we do not have remember it all the time and we can access our solutions anytime we want.

<b>CutCode</b> is an open source tool made for developers to boost their productivity and save their time by helping them save essential code as snippets in safe place. These code snippets are stored in an orderly fashion and can be searched and accessed at anytime. It is a very helpful tool as the developers no longer need to remember their solutions and where they originally found them.
